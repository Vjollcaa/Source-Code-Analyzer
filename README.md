# Source-Code-Analyzer
Design and implementation of the algorithm for code analysis in the testing aspect.

This program is used to analyze a given method.

* It analyzes the input parameters of the given method 
* Determines what type of output the method returns
* Calculates the cyclomatic complexity of the given method
* Shows the minimum and maximum number of test cases needed in order to test this method
* Shows with which initial values the method should be tested first (based on the analysis of the input parameters)
* It analyzes the conditions and determines if they are dependent from the input variable or not
